Course Description
Calendar Description for STAT 230:
This course provides an introduction to probability models including sample spaces, mutually exclusive
and independent events, conditional probability and Bayes' Theorem. The named distributions (Discrete
Uniform, Hypergeometric, Binomial, Negative Binomial, Geometric, Poisson, Continuous Uniform,
Exponential, Normal (Gaussian), and Multinomial) are used to model real phenomena. Discrete and
continuous univariate random variables and their distributions are discussed. Joint probability functions,
marginal probability functions, and conditional probability functions of two or more discrete random
variables and functions of random variables are also discussed. Students learn how to calculate and
interpret means, variances and covariances particularly for the named distributions. The Central Limit
Theorem is used to approximate probabilities.

STAT 231 relies very heavily on the concepts from STAT 230. It is recommended that you take STAT 231 as
soon as possible after completing STAT 230. To move forward to STAT 231, you only need a passing grade
(50%) in STAT 230. However, to take upper-year STAT courses such as 330, 333, 334, or 340, you need a
minimum grade of 60% in STAT 230.
Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:
Define a probability model and determine probabilities of events using counting techniques.
Distinguish between mutually exclusive and independent events, and calculate conditional probabilities
using Bayes’ Rule.
Distinguish between discrete and continuous random variables.
Define and use probability mass functions/probability density functions and cumulative distribution
functions to determine probabilities of events.
Use moment generating functions as a tool to determine expected values.
Define and use joint probability mass functions, marginal probability mass functions, and conditional
probability mass functions to determine probabilities of events involving two or more discrete random
variables.
Use the law of total expectation to calculate expected values through the principle of conditioning.
Use the named distributions (Discrete Uniform, Binomial, Hypergeometric, Geometric, Negative Binomial,
Poisson, Continuous Uniform, Exponential, Normal, and Multinomial) to model real-life phenomena.
Calculate and interpret means, variances, and covariances, particularly for the named distributions.
Understand the theory behind several important inequalities in probability and what the Weak Law of
Large Numbers conveys.
Define the Central Limit Theorem and use it to approximate probabilities.
Tentative Course Schedule
The following table provides a tentative schedule for the material you are responsible for in STAT 230,
along with sections in the Course Notes indicated. The material in this course is cumulative and you are
expected to attend all the lectures, read all the posted lecture notes, and do the end-of-section problems
in order to learn the material and prepare for the quizzes, term tests, and final exam. This learning consists
of you taking the time to carefully read the lecture notes on your own, making sure you understand the
concepts and steps demonstrated in the lectures to tackle examples, and then solving the end-of-section
problems. Solutions to the end-of-section problems will be posted in a timely fashion on the course
website on LEARN (https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home) . However, it is expected that you attempt the
problems on your own first prior to consulting the provided solutions. The weeks for tutorials, tutorial
quizzes, and term tests are also provided.  Please be sure to take note of the important dates indicated
below.

Out-of-Class Workload:
As in any university course, much of your learning will take place outside of class time. Each week, you
have 3 hours of lectures. Therefore, you should plan to spend 3 to 6 hours each week in out-of-class
learning. This learning consists mostly of making sure you understand the concepts and steps that were
introduced and used in class to solve examples and then solving problems from the Course Notes on your
own.
Missed Lectures:
If you miss lectures, then you are responsible for reaching out to a classmate in order to find out what was
missed.  Also, please note that instructors may annotate lecture slides during class time, but these
annotations will generally not be available on LEARN (https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home) after the
lecture.

There are two grading schemes in place, so as to minimize the impact of a poor performance on either of
the two term tests. (See below for details.)
All assessments will be graded and returned electronically using Crowdmark. If you have a question
regarding the marking of an assessment, you should first check the posted solutions on the LEARN
(https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home) website. If you still have a question, then you should follow the
procedure which will be posted on the LEARN (https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home) website once an
assessment has been graded and feedback has been returned to you. From the time an assessment is
returned to you, you have one week to appeal a grade (no exceptions will be made for any reason).
Students must write BOTH term tests in order to qualify for Scheme 2. Otherwise, Scheme 1 will
automatically be used. (See below for how your final grade is determined if you miss any term tests.) A
student’s final grade in STAT 230 is the maximum of the two grades calculated using Scheme 1 and
Scheme 2.
A 2.5-hour final cumulative examination will be held during the final exam period, in December. Please do
not make any travel plans before the final exam schedule is posted.
Information regarding the tutorial quizzes, term tests, and final exam (e.g., room locations) will be posted
on the course website on LEARN (https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home) .
Students must present a valid Student ID card to write all tutorial quizzes, term tests, and the final exam.
For the tutorial quizzes, term tests, and final exam, only a non-programmable, non-graphical, Math-faculty
approved calculator with a pink-tie or blue goggle sticker will be allowed.
If you miss a Tutorial Quiz for whatever reason, there is no need to e-mail the instructor. Keep in mind that
your Quiz Mark for the course will be comprised by taking your best 3 out of 5 quizzes.
If you miss a Term Test due to illness or extenuating circumstances, you must send an e-mail to Funmilayo
Adeku at fadeku@uwaterloo.ca (mailto:fadeku@uwaterloo.ca) within 48 hours of the missed Term Test. For
a missed Term Test with proper documentation, the weight will be shifted to the Final Exam.
If you miss the Final Exam due to illness or extenuating circumstances, you must send an e-mail to
Funmilayo Adeku at fadeku@uwaterloo.ca (mailto:fadeku@uwaterloo.ca) within 48 hours of the missed
Final Exam. If you miss the Final Exam with proper documentation, then the Mathematics Faculty INC
Grade Policy (https://uwaterloo.ca/math/current-undergraduates/regulations-and-procedures/incomplete-
procedure) will apply. Normally, if you have not earned a passing grade on your term work and you do not
write the Final Exam, then you will receive a mark of DNW (Did Not Write) for the course.
Missed term tests without proper documentation are automatically awarded a grade of 0.

8/12

If you miss both term tests and you do not write the final exam, you will be ineligible for an INC. In this
case, you will automatically receive a grade of DNW.
In the case of illness, you may declare your absence or submit a completed University of Waterloo
Verification of Illness Form (VIF) to the Math Undergraduate Office, MC 4022. Remember that you must
send an e-mail to Funmilayo Adeku at fadeku@uwaterloo.ca (mailto:fadeku@uwaterloo.ca) within 48 hours
of a missed term test or final exam.  No documentation is needed for a missed quiz, as we are taking your
best 3 out of 5 quizzes.
See Faculty of Mathematics' Accommodations (https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations/submission)
webpage.
In the case of extenuating circumstances, you must provide sufficient documentation via e-mail to
Funmilayo Adeku at fadeku@uwaterloo.ca (mailto:fadeku@uwaterloo.ca)  as soon as possible to verify the
circumstances surrounding your absence.
Assignment Screening
No assignment screening will be used in this course.

Generative AI:
This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Therefore, the use
of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to
produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this
class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to
complete a course assessment is considered a violation of Policy 71
(https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71)  (plagiarism or unauthorized
aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original
work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust,
respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (ICAI (https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-
Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf) , n.d.). 
You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough
notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these
notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If
11/17/24, 6:51 PM

the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to
provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if
you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the
Associate Dean. 
In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is
unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory
Committee: https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence
