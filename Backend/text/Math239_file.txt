Office Hours
Each instructor will have one office hour per week (starting the week of September 9).  The schedule is
posted on LEARN, and any changes will be posted as announcements. You are welcome to come to any
instructor's office hours, not just your own section.
Piazza
Outside of office hours, Piazza is the primary medium for all questions related to the course, except for
questions of a personal nature which can be sent to your instructor by email.  
The aim is to create a positive learning environment for everyone. Please be professional and courteous.
Keep in mind that posts can be made anonymous to other students, but are identifiable to instructors and
TA's.
You should use Piazza for:
Questions and discussion about lectures.
For assignment problems, you can ask for clarifications, but do not post any full or partial solutions,
nor any strong hints. If you have a specific question that include partial solutions to assignment
problems, please use private posts.
Requesting a regrade (private post; see instructions on Regrade Requests below).
Please put some thought into your questions and posts. You should show that you have worked on the
problem in some way. A post of the form "I'm stuck, any hints?" is not appropriate.

You are encouraged to help each other and answer questions. For student answers that are correct and do
not require additional clarification, the course staff will endorse them without making a further response. 
We will aim to provide a prompt response on Piazza, but response times on weekends/holidays may be
longer.  Piazza will be monitored at least one hour per day Monday to Friday.
Course Description
Calendar Description for MATH 239:
Introduction to graph theory: colourings, matchings, connectivity, planarity. Introduction to combinatorial
analysis: generating series, recurrence relations, binary strings, plane trees.
View requirements for MATH 239 (https://acal.fast.uwaterloo.ca/course/1249/MATH/239)
MATH 239 is an introduction to combinatorics and is both fun and useful.  This material is closely related to
many of the staple puzzle book questions you may have pondered as a kid, and is also foundational to
every discipline involving discrete structures including theoretical computer science.  The course is
primarily theoretical and you will develop your proof-writing skills while working with interesting and useful
structures.
The first portion of the course is combinatorial enumeration.  If you enjoyed puzzle book questions like
"how many ways can you tile a 2 x n board with dominoes?" then you will like this part.  If you ever
wondered how the number of binary trees grows and how we know that, then you will like this part.
 Practically, you will learn about generating series, which are one of the most important tools in algebraic
enumeration, particularly with a focus on classes of binary strings as examples of regular languages, and
you will learn how to solve recurrence equations.  You will play with combinatorial objects like compositions
of an integer.
The second portion of the course is graph theory. If you enjoyed puzzle book questions of the form "can
you draw a given figure without lifting your pencil or retracing any line?", then you will like this part.  If you
like to think about the structures of networks then you will like this part.  Practically you will learn the
formal foundations of graph theory, standard results and how to prove them, and some key graph
algorithms.
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course students should be able to:
recognize and work with a variety of combinatorial objects,
know standard results and techniques related to them to solve combinatorial problems, and
be comfortable writing proofs for results on discrete objects.
Tentative Course Schedule
This is a tentative schedule with topics that we plan to cover.

Two sets of course notes are provided. The first set of notes will be used for only the enumeration part,
and is denoted EN in the course schedule. The second set is course notes for the whole course, covering
both the enumeration part and the graph theory part; we will be using these for the graph theory part of
the course. This set of notes is denoted IC in the course schedule. During the first 5 weeks of the course,
in which we will study enumeration, instructors may choose to follow one set or the other more closely at
their discretion, but the material in both cases will be essentially the same.

Your grade will be determined automatically as the best of Grading Scheme A and Grading Scheme
B. This means that taking the midterm can only help your grade - receiving a 0 grade on the midterm is the
same as missing the midterm entirely.
Assignments. Assignments will be due on Tuesdays at 11:59pm Waterloo time on Crowdmark.
Roughly speaking, lecture material from week n-2 will be in the assignment due in week n. Assignments will
be submitted using Crowdmark. The two lowest assignment grades will be dropped, to allow for
unforeseen circumstances such as illness. Late submissions will receive a grade of 0.
You may ask your instructors or TAs for help during office hours or tutorials. You may also discuss the
assignments in small groups, and are encouraged to do so. However, you must write up the solutions on
your own. This means that you may not write up your solutions while you are with a group, and you should
not consult any notes you have taken during your group discussions while writing up your solutions.
Many assignment questions are proof questions and you will be evaluated on the logic and presentation of
your ideas. Aim to present your proofs at a level that would be understood by an average student in the
class who has not thought about the problem yet. 
You may NOT use any materials outside of the following:
all of the material posted on the MATH 239 Fall 2024 Learn course webpage
all of the material on the MATH 239 Fall 2024 Piazza webpage
all of the material presented during lectures, tutorials, oﬃce hours or provided to you directly by TAs
and instructors.
In particular you may NOT search electronic resources for solutions to assignment questions, use
Generative AI (see policy below), or use solutions obtained from previous offerings of this course or any
other course. Any submitted assignments that are suspected of cheating will be sent directly to the
Integrity Office of the Faculty of Mathematics.
Piazza bonus. Up to 2% will be available as a bonus for positive contributions on Piazza, such as asking
good questions or helping answer questions. Use Piazza's "endorsement" mechanism – "good question",
"helpful", etc. – to flag good contributions.

Grading scheme. Note: The pass requirement is 50% based on the above formula; there is no requirement
to separately pass the midterm or final exam in order to pass the course. However, some programs or
subsequent courses may require higher grades for progression, please check the course calendar to see if
this applies for you.
Regrade requests. If you believe the grader has made an error in grading your assignment, you may
request a regrade. This request must be made in a private post on piazza (not via email!) titled 'Regrade
Request for Assignment X', and you must provide a specific reason for the regrade. Any such request
must be made within 1 week of receiving the graded assignment. The grader may look at all problems on
the assignment and adjust your grade in any or all of them; your grade may go up or down, depending on
the grading errors detected. You may not request a regrade of a regraded assignment. 
Exams. There will be midterm and ﬁnal exams that both take place on campus unless the university
guidance prohibits in‐person exams for public health reasons. The midterm will take place on Tuesday,
November 5; see Odyssey for seat assignments. The ﬁnal exam will be scheduled by the registrar during
the ﬁnal exam period and will be announced during the term. 
Illness and self-declared student absences.
Assignments: There are no extensions for assignments, and late assignments will not be accepted.
The lowest 2-out-of-9 assignments will be dropped automatically, without penalty.  This is the
mechanism that will be applied to missed assignments due to illnesses or self-declared student
absences.  In particular, you do not need to declare your self-declared student absence or notify
your instructor to take advantage of dropping the lowest 2-out-of-9 assignments; this will be applied
automatically. Furthermore, submitting a VIF or self-declared absence declaration will not increase
the number of assignments you may miss. For example, if you submit a VIF for missing 3
assignment, your assignment grade will still be calculated from the highest of 7/9 assignments. For
another example, if you receive AccessAbility accommodations to skip 3 assignments, your grade
will be calculated from the highest of 6/9 assignments, even if you also submit (one or more) VIFs for
missing additional assignments.
Midterm: If the midterm exam is missed, the weight of the midterm will be transferred to the final
exam. (Keep in mind that missing the midterm is equivalent to taking it and getting a 0 on it.)
Final: If the final exam is missed due to documented illness (using the Math Faculty's Verification of
Illness form (https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations) ) AND the student has a passing grade in
the other two components of the course (assignments and midterm), an INC (incomplete)
(https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations#INC) grade will be assigned and the student may
complete the course by writing the final exam in a later offering of the course. In particular, if the
midterm exam is also missed then there will be no basis for assigning an INC grade.
Assignment Screening
No assignment screening will be used in this course.

Administrative Policy
Mental health support: Especially in these difficult times, it is important to seek out support if you are
struggling.  On-campus resources include Campus Wellness, Counselling Services, and the one-on-one
peer support program MATES.  Off-campus resources include Good2Talk 1-866-925-5454, EMPOWER ME
1-833-628-5589 in Canada and the US, or see
http://studentcare.ca/rte/en/IHaveAPlan_WUSA_EmpowerMe_EmpowerMe for other countries. Also
OK2BME provides support services for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or questioning youth. Phone
519-884-0000 extension 213 (Waterloo Region only).
Diversity: It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by
this course, and that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class. We recognize the
immense value of the diversity in identities, perspectives, and contributions that students bring, and the
benefit it has on our educational environment. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please
let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or
student groups. In particular: We will gladly honour your request to address you by an alternative/preferred
name or gender pronoun. Please advise us of this preference early in the term so we may make appropriate
changes to our records. We will honour your religious holidays and celebrations. Please inform of us these
at the start of the course. We will follow AccessAbility Services guidelines and protocols on how to best
support students with different learning needs.
Generative AI
This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills which can only be
learned through consistent independent work. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence
(GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or
code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this
course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment
is considered a violation of Policy 71 (https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-
guidelines/policy-71)  (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance
of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental
values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (ICAI
(https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf) , n.d.). 
You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough
notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these
notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If
the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to
provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if
you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the
Associate Dean. 
In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is
unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory
Committee: https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence
(https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence) 
Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework

University Policy
Academic integrity: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of
Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check
the Office of Academic Integrity (https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/) for more information.]
Grievance: A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been
unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read Policy 70, Student Petitions and
Grievances, Section 4 (https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70) . When
in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further
assistance.
Discipline: A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an
academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check the Office of Academic Integrity
(https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/) for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action
constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or
about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic
advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of
penalties, students should refer to Policy 71, Student Discipline (https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-
procedures-guidelines/policy-71) . For typical penalties, check Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties
(https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties) .
Appeals: A decision made or penalty imposed under Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances
(https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70) (other than a petition) or Policy
71, Student Discipline (https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71) may be
appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to
Policy 72, Student Appeals (https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72) .
Note for students with disabilities: AccessAbility Services (https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/) ,
located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate
accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the
curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register
with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.
Turnitin.com: Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course.
Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students'
submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded
assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students
will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided,
about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.
